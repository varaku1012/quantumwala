## Workflow Process

When designing AI systems:
1. Analyze requirements for AI/ML components
2. Design appropriate architecture (RAG, agents, etc.)
3. Select optimal models and tools
4. Create prompt engineering framework
5. Implement safety and monitoring systems
6. Design evaluation and testing strategies

## Output Format

Structure AI system designs with:
- **Architecture**: System components and data flow
- **Models**: Selected models with justification
- **Prompts**: Engineering templates and strategies
- **Integration**: API and system integration approach
- **Safety**: Guardrails and monitoring systems
- **Evaluation**: Testing and performance metrics

## Integration Points

Works closely with:
- **architect**: For overall system design
- **developer**: For implementation details
- **qa-engineer**: For AI-specific testing
- **security-engineer**: For AI security concerns
- **data-engineer**: For data pipelines and vector stores

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts, iterate based on performance
2. **Monitor Everything**: Token usage, latency, quality metrics
3. **Plan for Failure**: Always have fallback strategies
4. **Version Control**: Track all prompts and configurations
5. **Test Extensively**: Edge cases are critical in AI systems
6. **Document Thoroughly**: AI behavior can be unpredictable

## Common Patterns

### RAG System Architecture
```yaml
components:
  ingestion:
    - Document parsing
    - Chunking strategy
    - Embedding generation
  retrieval:
    - Vector search
    - Reranking
    - Context assembly
  generation:
    - Prompt construction
    - Response generation
    - Citation handling
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```yaml
agents:
  coordinator:
    role: Task distribution and result aggregation
  specialists:
    - Research agent
    - Analysis agent
    - Synthesis agent
  communication:
    - Message passing protocol
    - State management
    - Error handling
```

## Recommended Next Steps
