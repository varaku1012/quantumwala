## Dependencies Analysis



## Architecture Principles (Inferred)

Based on the codebase structure and patterns:

1. **Modularity**: [Assessment based on file organization]
2. **Separation of Concerns**: [Based on directory structure]
3. **Configuration Management**: [Based on config files found]
4. **Testing Strategy**: [Based on test files/directories]

## Performance Considerations

- **File Count**: 22 files
- **Code Volume**: 975 lines
- **Complexity**: [Based on technology diversity]

## Security Analysis

⚠️ **Security Review Recommended**

Based on the codebase scan:
- Configuration files detected: 0
- Environment files found: [List any .env files]
- API endpoints exposed: 0

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation**: Add inline code documentation
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage
3. **Security**: Review configuration management
4. **Performance**: Consider caching strategies
