## Organization Patterns

Based on the directory structure analysis:

### Code Organization
- **Main directories**: 3 directories analyzed
- **File distribution**: Varies by directory
- **Naming conventions**: [Analyzed from file/directory names]

### Development Workflow (Inferred)

1. **Source Code**: Located in [main source directories]
2. **Configuration**: Centralized in config files
3. **Testing**: [Based on test directory presence]
4. **Build Process**: [Based on build files detected]

## Conventions Analysis

### File Naming
- **Pattern consistency**: [Based on file name analysis]
- **Extension usage**: [Based on file type distribution]

### Directory Structure
- **Logical grouping**: [Assessment of organization]
- **Separation of concerns**: [Based on directory purposes]
