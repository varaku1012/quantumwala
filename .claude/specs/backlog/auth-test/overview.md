# Auth Test Feature Overview

## Vision
The auth-test feature provides a comprehensive demonstration of user authentication functionality, showcasing secure login and logout capabilities. This feature serves as both a functional authentication system and a reference implementation for future authentication-related development.

## Core Functionality
The feature includes a simple yet robust login interface where users can authenticate using email/username and password credentials. Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to a protected dashboard area, while failed attempts display appropriate error messages. The system maintains session state and provides a clear logout mechanism that properly terminates user sessions.

## Success Criteria
Success is measured by seamless user authentication flow, proper session management, and clear user feedback throughout the login process. The implementation should demonstrate security best practices while maintaining a user-friendly interface that can serve as a foundation for more complex authentication features.
