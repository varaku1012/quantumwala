# Test Context Integration - Detailed Requirements

## Context Alignment

### Product Vision Reference
This feature demonstrates our core vision to "transform Claude Code into an enterprise-scale multi-agent development platform that enables autonomous, coordinated software development through specialized AI agents." Specifically, it validates our **Steering Context System** - the foundational capability that maintains persistent project knowledge across all agent interactions.

### Technical Standards Applied
- **Agent Architecture**: File-based context loading following `.claude/steering/` structure
- **Communication Patterns**: File-based state with automatic context injection
- **Development Standards**: Python 3.7+ utilities, Markdown documentation, Git discipline
- **Quality Requirements**: 100% context loading success, graceful degradation, clear error handling

### Structural Patterns Followed
- **Directory Organization**: Using established `.claude/specs/test-context-integration/` structure
- **File Naming**: Following kebab-case conventions for feature directories
- **Documentation Standards**: Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria

## User Stories

### Epic: Demonstrate Context-First Development

#### US-1: Automatic Context Loading
**As a** software developer using Claude Code  
**I want** every agent to automatically load current steering context  
**So that** I never need to re-explain project details or architectural decisions

**Value Proposition**: Eliminates context repetition and ensures consistency across all agent interactions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** any agent is invoked for the test-context-integration feature
- **When** the agent begins processing
- **Then** it automatically loads relevant steering context from product.md, tech.md, and structure.md
- **And** the context loading completes within 2 seconds
- **And** agent outputs reference loaded context appropriately

#### US-2: Cross-Agent Context Consistency
**As a** development team lead  
**I want** all agents to work with the same understanding of project vision and standards  
**So that** outputs from different agents are aligned and consistent

**Value Proposition**: Prevents inconsistencies and rework due to misaligned agent outputs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** multiple agents work on the same feature sequentially
- **When** each agent processes their assigned task
- **Then** all outputs align with the same product vision from steering documents
- **And** technical standards are consistently applied across all agents
- **And** structural patterns are followed uniformly

#### US-3: Context Validation Gates
**As a** quality assurance engineer  
**I want** automatic validation of agent outputs against steering documents  
**So that** I can catch alignment issues before they propagate

**Value Proposition**: Prevents context drift and maintains quality standards automatically

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** an agent produces output for the test feature
- **When** context validation is triggered
- **Then** the system checks alignment with product principles
- **And** validates adherence to technical standards
- **And** confirms structural pattern compliance
- **And** provides specific feedback on any misalignment

### Epic: Demonstrate Agent Specialization

#### US-4: Domain-Focused Context Application
**As a** specialized agent (product-manager, architect, developer, etc.)  
**I want** to receive only context relevant to my domain and current task  
**So that** I can maintain focus while leveraging shared project understanding

**Value Proposition**: Maintains agent specialization while providing necessary context

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** a specialized agent is working on a specific task
- **When** context is loaded for that agent
- **Then** only relevant sections from steering documents are included
- **And** context is filtered based on agent role and task type
- **And** agent maintains domain expertise without context pollution

#### US-5: Seamless Agent Handoffs
**As a** orchestrating system  
**I want** agents to hand off work with complete context preservation  
**So that** no information is lost between development phases

**Value Proposition**: Enables smooth workflow progression without manual context management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** one agent completes work and hands off to another
- **When** the receiving agent begins processing
- **Then** all relevant context from previous phases is available
- **And** steering document context is preserved and applied
- **And** no re-explanation of project details is required

### Epic: Demonstrate Autonomous Coordination

#### US-6: Self-Coordinating Workflow
**As a** development workflow  
**I want** agents to coordinate automatically using shared context  
**So that** human intervention is minimized while maintaining quality

**Value Proposition**: Reduces manual coordination overhead while ensuring consistent outputs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** multiple agents need to work on related tasks
- **When** the workflow progresses through phases
- **Then** agents self-coordinate using shared steering context
- **And** dependencies are identified based on project structure patterns
- **And** progress tracking follows established phase-based development

#### US-7: Context Evolution Handling
**As a** project maintainer  
**I want** context updates to propagate automatically to all agents  
**So that** project evolution doesn't cause context drift

**Value Proposition**: Keeps all agents aligned as project requirements and standards evolve

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** steering documents are updated during development
- **When** agents are invoked after the update
- **Then** all agents use the latest context automatically
- **And** previous outputs can be validated against new context
- **And** alignment issues are identified and reported

## Routing Recommendation

Based on the requirements analysis:

**Primary Next Agent**: `architect`
- **Why**: Requirements include complex context loading infrastructure, performance optimization, and system integration patterns
- **Focus Areas**: Context loading architecture, performance optimization strategies, integration with existing Claude Code systems
- **Key Decisions Needed**: Caching mechanisms, error handling patterns, TMUX coordination architecture

**Secondary Agents** (can run in parallel):
1. `developer`: Begin implementing context loading utilities while architect designs overall system
2. `qa-engineer`: Start planning test scenarios for context validation and performance testing

**Suggested Command**:
```
Use architect agent to design the technical implementation for test-context-integration feature, focusing on context loading infrastructure, performance optimization, and integration patterns with our existing Claude Code multi-agent system
```
