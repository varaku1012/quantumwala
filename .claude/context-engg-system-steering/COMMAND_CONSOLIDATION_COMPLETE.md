## üóÑÔ∏è Commands Archived (26)

### Grooming Workflow (5 commands)
- `grooming-workflow.md`
- `grooming-start.md`
- `grooming-prioritize.md`
- `grooming-roadmap.md`
- `grooming-complete.md`
- **Reason**: Complex workflow not needed with simplified system

### Bug Management (5 commands)
- `bug-create.md`
- `bug-analyze.md`
- `bug-fix.md`
- `bug-verify.md`
- `bug-status.md`
- **Reason**: Use spec workflow for bug fixes

### Analysis Tools (4 commands)
- `analyze-codebase.md`
- `analyze-codebase-execution.py`
- `strategic-analysis.md`
- `parallel-analysis.md`
- **Reason**: Complex analysis rarely needed, use agents directly

### Dev Setup (2 commands)
- `dev-setup.md`
- `dev-mode.md`
- **Reason**: One-time setup, rarely used

### Spec Extras (3 commands)
- `spec-orchestrate.md`
- `spec-promote.md`
- `spec-steering-setup.md`
- **Reason**: Redundant with main workflow

### Old Systems (7 commands)
- `dashboard.md`
- `performance.md`
- `state-backup.md`
- `log-manage.md`
- `planning.md`
- `resume-etsypro.md`
- `feature-complete.md`
- **Reason**: Old monitoring/state systems, no longer needed

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Common Tasks

#### Creating a Feature
```bash
# Old way (complex):
/grooming-workflow "feature"
/grooming-prioritize
/spec-create
/spec-orchestrate

# New way (simple):
/spec-create "feature"
/workflow "feature"
```

#### Fixing a Bug
```bash
# Old way:
/bug-create "bug description"
/bug-analyze
/bug-fix
/bug-verify

# New way:
/spec-create "fix-bug-xyz"
/workflow "fix-bug-xyz"
```

#### Running Analysis
```bash
# Old way:
/analyze-codebase
/strategic-analysis

# New way:
# Use agent directly via Task tool
Task: codebase-analyst
Description: "Analyze the codebase"
```

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### Quantitative
- **68% reduction** in commands (38 ‚Üí 12)
- **100% redundancy** eliminated
- **4 clear categories** instead of 8+

### Qualitative
- **Simpler user experience** - Clear what each command does
- **No confusion** - One way to do each task
- **Easier maintenance** - Fewer commands to maintain
- **Better documentation** - Simpler to document and learn

---

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Direct Execution Preferred
Instead of many commands, users can now directly use:
```bash
# Direct script execution
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py [spec-name]

# This is often simpler than:
/workflow [spec-name]
```

### Command Categories Are Clear
1. **Workflow**: Execute specs
2. **Spec**: Manage specifications  
3. **Setup**: One-time project setup
4. **System**: Version info

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Consider Further Simplification
Could potentially reduce to just 7-8 commands:
- Merge `/workflow` and `/workflow-control`
- Combine some spec commands
- Move setup to documentation

### Focus on Direct Execution
- Encourage using `start_workflow.py` directly
- Commands become shortcuts for common tasks
- Less abstraction, more clarity

## ‚ú® Result

From **38 confusing commands** to **12 essential commands** - a clean, focused command interface that's easy to understand and use.
