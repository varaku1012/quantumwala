# Claude Code Integration Guide

## Understanding Claude Code's Architecture

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Sub-Agents
- Specialized AI assistants for specific tasks
- Defined in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Have access to specific tools
- Can delegate to other agents via Task tool

#### 2. Tools Available to Agents
- **Task**: Delegate to another agent
- **Read**: Read files
- **Write**: Write files
- **Shell**: Execute shell commands (Bash on Unix, PowerShell on Windows)
- **CreateDirectory**: Create directories
- **ListDirectory**: List directory contents
- **WebFetch**: Fetch web content (if enabled)
- **WebSearch**: Search the web (if enabled)

#### 3. Commands
- User-triggered workflows defined in `.claude/commands/`
- Can compose multiple operations
- Executed via `/command-name` syntax
- NOT directly called by agents (agents use Task tool)

## Proper Agent-to-Agent Communication

### Using the Task Tool

When an agent needs to delegate work:

```python
# CORRECT - Agent uses Task tool
Task(
    agent="developer",
    description="Implement user authentication module",
    context={
        "requirements": "...",
        "constraints": "..."
    }
)
```

```python
# INCORRECT - Agent calling commands
/spec-create user-auth  # ❌ Agents shouldn't call commands
```

### Task Tool Parameters

The Task tool accepts:
- **agent**: Name of target agent
- **description**: Clear task description
- **context**: Optional context object

## How Our System Enhances Claude Code

### 1. Agent Tool Bridge
**Purpose**: Intercepts Task tool calls to add functionality
**Benefits**:
- Context optimization (70% token reduction)
- Memory integration (learning from past)
- Parallel execution management
- Intelligent routing

### 2. Context Engineering
**Purpose**: Optimizes information flow
**Benefits**:
- Reduces token usage
- Improves relevance
- Prevents contamination
- Enables larger workflows

### 3. Memory System
**Purpose**: Learn from executions
**Benefits**:
- Provides few-shot examples
- Improves over time
- Reduces repeated mistakes
- Speeds up similar tasks

### 4. Planning System
**Purpose**: Optimize execution strategy
**Benefits**:
- Identifies parallelization opportunities
- Creates dependency graphs
- Batches operations
- Reduces total time

## Configuration for Claude Code

### 1. Agent Definition Format
```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does
tools: Task, Read, Write
---

Agent instructions here...
```

### 2. Command Definition Format
```markdown
---
name: my-command
description: What this command does
---

Run: python .claude/scripts/my_script.py {args}
```

### 3. Settings Configuration
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(find:*)", "WebFetch(domain:docs.anthropic.com)"]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "post_command": {
      "enabled": true,
      "script": ".claude/hooks/post-command.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Claude Code

### DO:
- ✅ Keep agents focused on single responsibility
- ✅ Use Task tool for delegation
- ✅ Pass context when delegating
- ✅ Define clear tool access
- ✅ Use commands for user workflows

### DON'T:
- ❌ Have agents call commands directly
- ❌ Create circular delegations
- ❌ Pass huge contexts (>8K tokens)
- ❌ Skip error handling
- ❌ Ignore tool permissions

## Common Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator Pattern
```markdown
Chief agent receives request
    → Analyzes requirements
    → Uses Task tool to delegate to specialists
    → Aggregates results
    → Returns to user
```

### 2. Pipeline Pattern
```markdown
Agent A completes task
    → Passes result as context
    → Agent B continues work
    → Passes enhanced result
    → Agent C finalizes
```

### 3. Parallel Pattern
```markdown
Orchestrator identifies independent tasks
    → Delegates to multiple agents simultaneously
    → Waits for all to complete
    → Combines results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Task delegation not working
**Check**:
1. Agent has Task tool in tools list
2. Target agent exists in `.claude/agents/`
3. Context is properly formatted
4. No circular dependencies

### Issue: Context too large
**Check**:
1. Context compression enabled
2. Selecting only relevant information
3. Using references instead of full content
4. Compression ratio adequate

### Issue: Agents not found
**Check**:
1. Agent file exists and properly named
2. YAML frontmatter correctly formatted
3. Name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
4. File extension is `.md`

## Integration with Claude Desktop

### Using Custom Agents in Claude Desktop:
1. Place agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`
2. Ensure proper YAML frontmatter
3. Restart Claude Desktop if needed
4. Agents auto-discovered

### Using Custom Commands:
1. Define in `.claude/commands/`
2. Use `/command-name` to trigger
3. Commands can use any script/tool
4. Results returned to conversation

## Advanced Features

### 1. Conditional Delegation
```python
if "security" in task_description:
    delegate_to = "security-engineer"
else:
    delegate_to = "developer"
```

### 2. Dynamic Context
```python
context = {
    "phase": current_phase,
    "previous_results": last_phase_output,
    "constraints": project_constraints,
    "examples": few_shot_examples
}
```

### 3. Result Validation
```python
result = await Task(agent="qa-engineer", description="validate implementation")
if not result.success:
    # Retry with different approach
    result = await Task(agent="developer", description="fix issues: " + result.errors)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Token Usage:
- Base Claude Code: ~20K tokens per complex task
- With Context Engineering: ~6K tokens (70% reduction)

### Execution Time:
- Sequential execution: ~36 seconds
- With parallelization: ~18 seconds (50% reduction)

### Memory Usage:
- Keep agent definitions small
- Compress contexts aggressively
- Clean up after execution
- Use streaming for large outputs

## Future Enhancements

### Planned:
1. WebSocket support for real-time updates
2. Advanced memory with vector databases
3. Multi-model support (Claude + others)
4. Visual workflow designer
5. Automated testing framework

### In Development:
1. Better error recovery
2. Smarter parallelization
3. Context streaming
4. Performance profiling
5. Integration testing
