## 📋 **AGENT COORDINATION PATTERNS**

### **Pattern 1: Sequential Coordination**
**Use Case**: Phase-based workflow where agents build on each other's work

```bash
# Business Application Development Sequence
1. /steering-setup                    # Steering Context Manager
2. Use chief-product-manager to create vision and roadmap
3. Use business-analyst to generate requirements
4. Use architect to create system design
5. Use spec-task-validator to validate implementation plan
6. Use developer agents to implement features
7. Use qa-engineer to validate implementation
8. Use code-reviewer for final quality check
```

**Coordination Method**: 
- Each agent reads previous agent outputs from `.claude/specs/{feature}/`
- Agents load steering context automatically for consistency
- State tracking via unified state manager ensures handoff completion

### **Pattern 2: Parallel Coordination**
**Use Case**: Independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously

```bash
# Analysis Phase (Parallel)
Use business-analyst to analyze user requirements for {feature-name} &
Use architect to design system architecture for {feature-name} &
Use uiux-designer to create user interface mockups for {feature-name} &
Use security-engineer to conduct threat modeling for {feature-name}

# Wait for all to complete, then proceed to design phase
```

**Coordination Method**:
- Resource manager allocates CPU/memory to each agent
- Unified state tracks parallel task completion
- Agents avoid file conflicts through atomic operations

### **Pattern 3: Collaborative Coordination**
**Use Case**: Agents working together on complex problems

```bash
# Performance Optimization Collaboration
Use performance-optimizer to profile application performance
Use architect to review performance bottlenecks and suggest architectural changes  
Use developer to implement performance optimizations
Use qa-engineer to validate performance improvements with load testing
```

**Coordination Method**:
- Shared context files in `.claude/specs/{feature}/shared/`
- Round-robin review and feedback loops
- Version-controlled design documents for collaborative editing

## 🔄 **AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

### **File-Based Communication**
Agents communicate through structured files:

**Input Files** (Read by agents):
- `.claude/steering/product.md` - Business context
- `.claude/steering/tech.md` - Technical standards  
- `.claude/steering/structure.md` - Code conventions
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/requirements.md` - Requirements
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/design.md` - System design

**Output Files** (Written by agents):
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/tasks.md` - Implementation tasks
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/tests.md` - Test specifications
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/review.md` - Quality review results

**Shared Files** (Read/Write by multiple agents):
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/shared/decisions.md` - Design decisions
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/shared/issues.md` - Open issues and blockers
- `.claude/specs/{feature}/shared/progress.md` - Implementation progress

### **State-Based Communication**
Agents coordinate through unified state:

```python
# Agent reads current workflow state
state = unified_state_manager.get_workflow_state()
current_phase = state['workflow']['global_phase']
my_tasks = state['specifications'][spec_name]['tasks']

# Agent updates state after completion
unified_state_manager.update_task_status(spec_name, task_id, TaskStatus.COMPLETED)
unified_state_manager.record_agent_execution(agent_name, success=True, duration=45.2)
```

### **Hook-Based Communication**
Agents trigger coordination through hooks:

```bash
# Agent completes task, hook triggers next agent
# phase-complete.sh detects completion
# Suggests next command to .claude/next_command.txt
# Suggestion consumer executes next agent automatically
```
