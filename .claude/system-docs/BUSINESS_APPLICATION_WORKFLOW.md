## üìã **PHASE-BY-PHASE WORKFLOW**

### **Phase 1: Business Context Setup**
**Objective**: Establish business application context and technical foundation

#### **Step 1.1: Initialize Project Context**
```bash
# Create steering context for business application

```

### **Phase 2: Specification Creation**
**Objective**: Create detailed feature specifications for business application

#### **Step 2.1: Create Feature Specification**
```bash
# Create specification for your business feature
/spec-create "user-management" "Complete user management system with authentication, authorization, and profile management"

# Or for e-commerce feature
/spec-create "product-catalog" "Product catalog with search, filtering, inventory management, and recommendations"

# Or for payment processing
/spec-create "payment-processing" "Secure payment processing with multiple gateways, subscription billing, and fraud detection"
```

#### **Step 2.2: Generate Business Requirements** (‚úÖ **AUTOMATED**)
```bash
# Automatically generate detailed business requirements
/spec-requirements

# This will use:
# - Business Analyst agent
# - Your product.md context
# - Industry best practices
# - Compliance requirements
```

**Generated Output**: `.claude/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md`
- User stories for different personas
- Acceptance criteria with business metrics
- Integration requirements with external services
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and compliance requirements

#### **Step 2.3: Create System Design** (‚úÖ **AUTOMATED**)
```bash
# Generate technical design aligned with business requirements  
/spec-design

# This will use:
# - Architect agent
# - Your tech.md standards  
# - Requirements.md as input
# - Integration patterns
```

**Generated Output**: `.claude/specs/{feature-name}/design.md`
- System architecture diagrams
- Database schema design
- API specifications
- Integration architecture

# Create atomic, agent-friendly implementation tasks
/spec-tasks

# This will use:
# - Spec Task Validator agent (proactive validation)
# - Requirements and design as input
# - Project structure conventions
# - Task atomicity principles
```

**Generated Output**: `.claude/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md`
- Atomic tasks (15-30 minutes each)
- Clear file specifications
- Agent assignments
- Dependency mapping
- Acceptance criteria per task

#### **Step 3.2: Plan Parallel Execution** (‚úÖ **AUTOMATED**)
```bash
# Analyze tasks and create parallel execution strategy
/planning implementation "{feature-name}"

# Output: Execution plan with parallel batches
# - Batch 1: Independent tasks (can run simultaneously)
# - Batch 2: Dependent tasks (after Batch 1)
# - Batch N: Final integration tasks
```

# 6. Run quality validation (QA Engineer + Code Reviewer)
# 7. Generate completion report
```

**Option B: Manual Orchestration with Real Execution**
```bash
# Execute with real Claude Code commands (not simulation)
python .claude/scripts/task_orchestrator.py "{feature-name}" --real

# Features:

# - Cross-specification dependencies
# - Business metric tracking
# - Automated quality gates
# - Performance optimization
```

#### **Step 4.2: Monitor Execution** (‚úÖ **REAL-TIME**)
```bash
# Launch real-time monitoring dashboard
python .claude/scripts/enhanced_dashboard.py

# Monitor:
# - Task completion progress
# - Agent performance metrics  
# - System resource usage
# - Error rates and recovery
# - Business KPI tracking
```

### **Phase 5: Business-Focused Quality Assurance**
**Objective**: Validate business requirements and user experience

# - Integration test plan (QA Engineer)  
# - Business logic validation (Business Analyst)
# - User acceptance testing (UI/UX Designer)
# - Performance testing (Performance Optimizer)
# - Security testing (Security Engineer)
```

#### **Step 5.2: Execute Quality Validation** (‚úÖ **PARALLEL**)
```bash
# Execute comprehensive quality validation
/spec-orchestrate "{feature-name}"

# Parallel execution:
# - Code quality review (Code Reviewer)
# - Security validation (Security Engineer)
# - Performance testing (Performance Optimizer)
# - Business requirement validation (Business Analyst)
# - User experience validation (UI/UX Designer)
```

### **Phase 6: Business Application Deployment**
