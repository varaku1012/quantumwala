# üöÄ Quick Reference: Next Session

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Steering Context implemented
- üîç Analysis Complete: Found critical Context Engineering features
- üö® Decision Needed: Implement Phase 2.5 or continue to Phase 2

## To Resume:

## Quick Decision Tree

### If you want Context Engineering (RECOMMENDED):
```
Say: "Let's implement Phase 2.5 Context Engineering"
Time: 2-3 hours
Benefit: 50-70% more efficient
```

### If you want to continue as planned:
```
Say: "Continue with Phase 2 validation agents"
Time: 1-2 hours
Note: Less efficient, may hit limits
```

### If you want minimal changes:
```
Say: "Just add the web researcher agent"
Time: 30 minutes
Note: Misses major improvements
```

## Key Benefits of Phase 2.5

| Current | With Phase 2.5 |
|---------|----------------|
| 15,000+ tokens per task | 3,000-5,000 tokens |
| Manual task editing | Automated updates |
| Windows paths only | Cross-platform |
| No API checking | Web research included |

## Files to Check
1. `DECISION_PHASE_2.5.md` - Your options
2. `PHASE_2.5_CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md` - Implementation plan
3. `URGENT_UPDATES_NEEDED.md` - Why this matters

## One-Line Summary
**Their Context Engineering makes agents 50-70% more efficient - implement before continuing!**
