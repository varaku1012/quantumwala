## Generated Outputs

### Steering Context Documents
Following the same format as manually created steering docs:

1. **product.md** - Product vision, users, features, success metrics
2. **tech.md** - Technology stack, architecture principles, standards
3. **structure.md** - Code organization, patterns, conventions

### Analysis Reports
- **Codebase Summary**: Executive overview of findings
- **Feature Matrix**: Complete capability inventory
- **Technology Assessment**: Stack analysis and recommendations
- **Gap Analysis**: Missing features and improvements
- **Performance Profile**: Scalability and optimization insights

### Metadata Tracking
All generated documents include:
```yaml
---
analysis_metadata:
  confidence_level: medium
  source_files_analyzed: 22
  analysis_date: 2025-08-04T09:28:03
  validation_required:
    - business_logic_accuracy
    - user_persona_validation
    - technical_architecture_review
---
```

## Testing Results

Successfully tested on the current project:
- **Files Analyzed**: 22 files, 975 lines of code
- **Technology Detection**: Python backend identified
- **Steering Documents**: Successfully generated all 3 steering docs
- **Export Functionality**: JSON analysis data exported
- **Performance**: Analysis completed in <5 seconds

## Integration with Multi-Agent Workflow

### Agent Orchestration
The codebase analyst integrates with other agents:
1. **Codebase Analyst** → **Chief Product Manager**: Strategic insights
2. **Codebase Analyst** → **Business Analyst**: Requirements extraction
3. **Codebase Analyst** → **Architect**: Technical validation
4. **Codebase Analyst** → **Developer**: Implementation recommendations

### Workflow Integration
```bash
# Complete workflow example
/analyze-codebase ./existing-project --deep
# Review generated steering documents
# Customize product context
/steering-setup
# Create specifications
/spec-create "feature-enhancement" "Based on gap analysis"
# Monitor with dashboard
/dashboard enhanced
```

## Key Innovation Features
