# Phase 2: Validation Agents & Enhanced Orchestration

## Overview
Phase 2 adds quality gates and validation throughout the workflow, ensuring higher quality outputs and catching issues early.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Validation Agents
- **spec-requirements-validator** - Validates requirements before review
- **spec-design-validator** - Ensures design covers requirements
- **spec-task-validator** - Checks tasks are atomic and executable
- **spec-implementation-reviewer** - Reviews completed code

### 2. Enhanced Orchestration
- **spec-orchestrate** command for automated execution
- Stateless design using tasks.md as truth
- Session recovery capabilities
- Agent delegation logic

### 3. Quality Gates
- Approval required between phases
- Automatic validation before user review
- Context validation at each step
- Structured feedback format

### 4. Execution Improvements
- spec-task-executor for focused implementation
- Context loading protocols
- Error handling and recovery
- Progress tracking

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Validation Agents
```bash
# These agents will be added:
.claude/agents/spec-requirements-validator.md
.claude/agents/spec-design-validator.md
.claude/agents/spec-task-validator.md
.claude/agents/spec-implementation-reviewer.md
```

### Step 2: Create Orchestration Command
```bash
# New command for automated execution:
.claude/commands/spec-orchestrate.md
```

### Step 3: Add Execution Scripts
```bash
# Scripts for context management:
.claude/scripts/get-content.py
.claude/scripts/get-tasks.py
.claude/scripts/validate-spec.py
```

### Step 4: Update Existing Commands
- Enhance `/spec-create` with validation gates
- Add context loading to all spec commands
- Integrate validation checkpoints

## Benefits of Phase 2
1. **Higher Quality** - Catch issues before implementation
2. **Automation** - Less manual oversight needed
3. **Consistency** - Standardized validation criteria
4. **Resilience** - Better error recovery

## Ready to Implement Phase 2?

Type "yes" to proceed with Phase 2 implementation, which will:
1. Add all validation agents
2. Create orchestration commands
3. Implement quality gates
4. Update workflow with validations

This phase will take approximately 10-15 minutes to implement fully.
