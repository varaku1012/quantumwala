# Business Case: QuantumClimate AI - Quantum-Enhanced Climate Risk & Carbon Materials Platform

## Executive Summary

QuantumClimate AI combines quantum computing's molecular simulation capabilities with generative AI to address two massive climate opportunities: (1) ultra-precise climate risk analytics for financial/insurance markets and (2) accelerated discovery of carbon capture materials. Our platform reduces material discovery time from decades to months while providing climate risk predictions 10x more accurate than current models.

**Market Opportunity**: The climate tech market exceeds $60B annually, with carbon capture reaching $30B by 2030 and climate risk analytics at $20B. Regulatory pressures (SEC climate disclosure, EU taxonomy) and net-zero commitments create urgent demand. We target $1B+ valuation by capturing 5% of the combined market within 6 years.

**Unique Value**: 
- Quantum algorithms for molecular dynamics of CO2-absorbing materials
- GenAI for rapid material property prediction and optimization
- Integrated platform from material discovery to climate risk modeling
- No quantum expertise required - AI translates needs to quantum solutions

**Investment Ask**: $40M Series A for platform development, material validation lab, and enterprise partnerships.
