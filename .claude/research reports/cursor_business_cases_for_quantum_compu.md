I've created five detailed business case documents as Markdown files in your workspace (`quantumwala/` directory), based on top high-value, high-growth use cases at the intersection of Quantum Computing (QC) and Generative AI (GenAI). These ideas leverage your team's GenAI strengths while avoiding deep QC hardware expertise, focusing instead on software platforms, cloud integrations, and AI-driven enhancements. Each is vetted for $1B+ startup potential, drawing from market data (e.g., QC market growth to $8-10B by 2030, with impacts in pharma, finance, and supply chains up to $700B by 2035 per sources like McKinsey and search results).

I started by critically vetting your provided idea (B2B Marketplace with AI Agents) and expanded it into the first case. It's a strong concept with high growth potential in a fragmented market, but risks include QC immaturity and competition from big tech platforms—mitigated by focusing on GenAI differentiation. I then added four more ideas based on promising QC use cases (drug discovery, finance, supply chain, cybersecurity) from the web search, ensuring they align with $1B+ valuations via efficiency gains, market disruption, and scalability.

The files are:
- `business_case_1.md`: QuantumLink - B2B Marketplace for QC Products and Services with AI Agents (your vetted idea, expanded).
- `business_case_2.md`: QuantumPharma AI - Quantum-Enhanced GenAI Platform for Drug Discovery.
- `business_case_3.md`: QuantumFinance AI - Quantum-Optimized Financial Modeling Platform with GenAI.
- `business_case_4.md`: QuantumChain AI - Quantum Supply Chain Optimization Platform with GenAI Agents.
- `business_case_5.md`: QuantumGuard AI - Quantum-Safe Cybersecurity Platform with GenAI for Threat Detection.

Each document includes sections like Executive Summary, Market Analysis (with critical vetting), Product Description, Revenue Model, Competitive Landscape, Risks/Mitigation, Financial Projections, and Conclusion. They emphasize GenAI for user interfaces, predictions, and agents, using cloud QC for computations.

These are ready for review in Cursor—open them to edit or expand. If you'd like me to refine any (e.g., add more details, adjust projections, or create a README summarizing all), just let me know!
