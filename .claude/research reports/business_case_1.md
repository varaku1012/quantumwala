# Business Case: QuantumLink - AI-Powered B2B Marketplace & Ecosystem for Quantum Computing

## Executive Summary

QuantumLink is an AI-first B2B marketplace and ecosystem platform that democratizes access to quantum computing resources, expertise, and solutions. By leveraging advanced GenAI agents for intelligent matching, automated negotiation, and technical translation, we address the fragmented quantum computing market's core challenge: connecting quantum-naive enterprises with appropriate solutions and providers. 

**Market Opportunity**: The quantum computing market is projected to grow from $1.3B (2024) to $5.3B by 2030 (BCG, more conservative than McKinsey's $8-10B). As a specialized marketplace capturing transaction fees and data insights, we target a $1B+ valuation by securing 15% market share of transactions by Year 7.

**Why Now**: 
- Quantum cloud services are maturing (IBM, AWS, Azure, Google)
- Enterprise pilots are accelerating but lacking guidance
- No specialized B2B marketplace exists (only general cloud providers)
- GenAI can now effectively translate between business needs and quantum capabilities

**Investment Ask**: $25M Series A to build platform, bootstrap liquidity, and achieve regulatory compliance.
