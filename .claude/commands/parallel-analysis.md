Run multiple agents in parallel for comprehensive analysis.

## Execution Plan

Launch 4 parallel tasks for complete analysis:

**Task 1: Business Requirements**
- Agent: business-analyst
- Focus: User stories, acceptance criteria
- Output: requirements.md

**Task 2: Technical Feasibility**
- Agent: architect  
- Focus: System design, technology choices
- Output: architecture.md

**Task 3: User Experience**
- Agent: uiux-designer
- Focus: User flows, wireframes
- Output: design.md

**Task 4: Security & Performance**
- Agent: code-reviewer
- Focus: Security implications, performance concerns
- Output: security-review.md

## Coordination

After all parallel tasks complete, I'll:
1. Synthesize findings
2. Identify conflicts or dependencies
3. Create unified recommendation
4. Generate implementation plan
