Resumes the EtsyPro AI development that was initialized but stopped after steering context.

## Current State
- ✅ Steering documents created (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
- ❌ No feature specifications created
- ❌ No implementation started

## Resume Command
```
/resume-etsypro
```

## Execution Plan

This command will automatically:

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
```
/master-orchestrate "user-authentication" "Secure multi-factor authentication with Etsy OAuth2 integration"
```

### Phase 2: Analytics Dashboard  
```
/master-orchestrate "analytics-dashboard" "Real-time metrics with predictive analytics and revenue forecasting"
```

### Phase 3: Revenue Optimization
```
/master-orchestrate "revenue-optimization" "AI-powered pricing engine with competitor analysis"
```

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- Test all components together
- Verify Etsy API integration
- Performance benchmarks

## What Will Happen

   - Check for existing specs
   - Determine starting point

2. **Execute Features Sequentially**
   - Each feature runs through complete workflow
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Automatic progression

3. **Generate Implementation**
