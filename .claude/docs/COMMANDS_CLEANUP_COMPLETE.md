## 🗄️ Commands Archived (26)

### Categories Removed
1. **Grooming Workflow** (5 commands) - Too complex, use spec workflow
2. **Bug Management** (5 commands) - Use spec workflow for bugs
3. **Analysis Tools** (4 commands) - Rarely used, call agents directly
4. **Dev Setup** (2 commands) - One-time setup
5. **Spec Extras** (3 commands) - Redundant with main workflow
6. **Old Systems** (7 commands) - Dashboard, logs, state management

## 🔄 Migration Examples

### Creating a Feature
```bash
# Old (complex):
/grooming-workflow "feature"
/grooming-prioritize
/spec-create
/spec-orchestrate

# New (simple):
/spec-create "feature"
/workflow "feature"

# Or even simpler:
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py feature-name
```

### Fixing a Bug
```bash
# Old:
/bug-create "bug"
/bug-analyze
/bug-fix
/bug-verify

# New:
/spec-create "fix-bug"
/workflow "fix-bug"
```

### Running Analysis
```bash
# Old:
/analyze-codebase
/strategic-analysis

# New (direct agent call):
Use codebase-analyst agent to analyze the codebase
```

## 📝 Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Primary workflow**: Use `/spec-create` then `/workflow`
2. **Direct execution**: Consider using `python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py`
3. **Simple is better**: Most tasks only need 2-3 commands

### For Future Development
1. **Resist adding commands** - Keep the interface minimal
2. **Prefer direct execution** - Scripts over commands when possible
3. **Maintain simplicity** - Don't recreate the complexity

## 🚀 Current Command Interface

The entire command interface now fits in one screen:

**Workflow**: `/workflow`, `/workflow-control`
**Specs**: `/spec-*` (7 commands for full lifecycle)
**Setup**: `/project-init`, `/steering-setup`
**Info**: `/version`

That's it! Simple, clean, effective.

## 📈 Historical Progress

1. **Original**: 51 commands (chaotic)
2. **Phase 1**: 37 commands (27% reduction)
3. **Phase 2**: 12 commands (76% total reduction)

The command interface is now **minimal, focused, and maintainable**.
