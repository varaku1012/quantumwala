# Detailed Workflow Execution Trace

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive trace of how the spec workflow executes step-by-step, including all agents, tools, scripts, and folder movements.

---

## 🚀 Workflow Execution Modes

### Available Modes
1. **basic** - Simple template generation (fastest, no AI)
2. **enhanced** - Proper folder structure and lifecycle
3. **logged** - Enhanced with comprehensive logging (recommended)
4. **full** - Full Context Engineering integration (most complete)

### Mode Selection Impact
```python
# In start_workflow.py
if args.mode == "full":
    from fully_integrated_workflow import FullyIntegratedWorkflow
elif args.mode == "logged":
    from logged_workflow_executor import LoggedWorkflowExecutor
elif args.mode == "enhanced":
    from enhanced_workflow_executor import EnhancedWorkflowExecutor
else:  # basic mode
    from execute_complete_development import CompleteDevelopmentWorkflow
```

## 📁 Spec Lifecycle Movement

### Folder Structure
```
.claude/specs/
├── backlog/      # Specs waiting to be implemented
├── scope/        # Specs currently being worked on
└── completed/    # Finished specs with implementations
```

### Movement Flow
```
[BACKLOG] → [SCOPE] → [COMPLETED]
   ↓           ↓           ↓
 Waiting    In Work    Finished
```

## 🔍 Detailed Execution Trace

### Step 1: User Initiates Workflow
```bash
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py user-auth --mode logged
```

### Step 2: Launcher Validates & Prepares
```python
# start_workflow.py:main()
├── Validates spec exists in source folder
├── Checks spec completeness (overview.md, requirements.md)
├── Selects appropriate executor based on mode
└── Calls asyncio.run(run_workflow(args))
```

### Step 3: Workflow Executor Initialization
```python
# logged_workflow_executor.py:__init__()
├── Sets up paths:
│   ├── spec_source: .claude/specs/backlog/user-auth
│   ├── spec_scope: .claude/specs/scope/user-auth
│   └── spec_completed: .claude/specs/completed/user-auth
├── Initializes WorkflowLogger
└── Creates workflow_id with timestamp
```

### Step 4: Phase 0 - Move Spec to Scope
```python
# move_spec_to_scope()
├── Verifies source spec exists
├── Creates scope directory if needed
├── Copies entire spec folder to scope/
│   └── shutil.copytree(spec_source, spec_scope)
├── Updates metadata:
│   ├── status: "IN_SCOPE"
│   ├── scope_date: current timestamp
│   └── workflow_id: unique identifier
├── Removes spec from backlog/
│   └── shutil.rmtree(spec_source)
└── Logs movement to workflow log
```

**Critical Point**: Spec is now in `scope/` folder, not in `backlog/`

### Step 5: Phases 1-8 - Processing
```python
# Each phase operates on spec in scope/ folder
Phase 1: Project Structure Definition
├── Reads: scope/user-auth/overview.md
├── Creates: services/, frontend/, infrastructure/ folders
└── Logs: structure creation

Phase 2: Requirements Analysis
├── Should call: business-analyst agent
├── Currently: Creates template requirements
├── Saves to: scope/user-auth/generated_requirements.json
└── Logs: requirements generation

Phase 3: System Design
├── Should call: architect agent
├── Currently: Creates template design
├── Saves to: scope/user-auth/generated_design.json
└── Logs: design creation

Phase 4: Task Generation
├── Should call: product-manager agent
├── Currently: Creates task list from structure
├── Saves to: scope/user-auth/generated_tasks.json
└── Logs: task breakdown

Phase 5: Code Implementation
├── Should call: developer agent
├── Currently: Creates template code files
├── Creates files in: services/, frontend/, ml-services/
└── Logs: each file created

Phase 6: Test Generation
├── Should call: qa-engineer agent
├── Currently: Creates stub test files
├── Creates: test/ folders in each service
└── Logs: test file creation

Phase 7: Documentation
├── Creates: implementations/user-auth/README.md
└── Logs: documentation generation

Phase 8: Infrastructure Setup
├── Should call: devops-engineer agent
├── Currently: Creates template configs
├── Creates: k8s/namespace.yaml, docker/docker-compose.yml
└── Logs: infrastructure setup
```

### Step 6: Phase 9 - Move Spec to Completed
```python
# move_spec_to_completed()
├── Verifies spec exists in scope/
├── Creates completed/ directory if needed
├── Copies entire spec folder to completed/
│   └── shutil.copytree(spec_scope, spec_completed)
├── Updates metadata:
│   ├── status: "COMPLETED"
│   ├── completion_date: current timestamp
│   ├── implementation_location: "implementations/user-auth"
│   ├── workflow_id: same as started
│   ├── log_file: path to workflow log
│   └── summary_file: path to summary
├── Removes spec from scope/
│   └── shutil.rmtree(spec_scope)
└── Verifies movement:
    ├── Checks spec_completed.exists() == True
    └── Checks spec_scope.exists() == False
```

**Critical Point**: Spec is now in `completed/` folder, removed from `scope/`

### Step 7: Phase 10 - Automated Validation
```python
# validate_execution()
├── Imports WorkflowValidator
├── Creates validator instance
├── Runs validation checks:
│   ├── Log files exist
│   ├── Spec properly moved
│   ├── Code files created
│   ├── Project structure compliant
│   └── All phases executed
├── Calculates health score (0-100)
├── Generates insights
├── Provides recommendations
└── Returns success if score >= 70
```

## 🔧 Agent Delegation (Current vs Intended)

### Current Implementation (Stubbed)
```python
# What happens now - NO real agent calls
async def generate_requirements(self):
    requirements = {
        "functional": [],
        "non_functional": [],
        "technical": []
    }
    # Just saves empty template
    req_file.write_text(json.dumps(requirements))
```

### Intended Implementation (With Agents)
```python
# What SHOULD happen - Real agent delegation
async def generate_requirements(self):
    # Using the Task tool to delegate
    result = await self.delegate_to_agent(
        agent_type="business-analyst",
        task=f"Generate detailed requirements for {self.spec_name}",
        context=self.get_spec_context()
    )
    # Save actual generated requirements
    req_file.write_text(result.output)
```

### Agent Call Pattern
```python
# Proper delegation flow
1. Load context from steering docs
2. Compress context for token optimization
3. Call agent with Task tool
4. Process agent response
5. Save results to spec folder
6. Log agent interaction
```

## 📊 Logging & Monitoring

### Log Files Created
```
.claude/logs/workflows/
├── 20250808_105219_user-auth_workflow.log      # Text log
├── 20250808_105219_user-auth_workflow.json     # Structured log
├── 20250808_105219_user-auth_summary.md        # Markdown summary
└── 20250808_105219_user-auth_validation.md     # Validation report
```

### What Gets Logged
- Phase start/end with timing
- Each file creation
- Each folder creation
- Agent calls (when implemented)
- Tool usage
- Errors and warnings
- Metrics (files created, time taken, etc.)
- Final health score

## 🚨 Critical Verification Points

### 1. Spec Movement Verification
```python
# After move_spec_to_scope()
assert not spec_source.exists()  # Removed from backlog
assert spec_scope.exists()       # Now in scope

# After move_spec_to_completed()
assert not spec_scope.exists()   # Removed from scope
assert spec_completed.exists()   # Now in completed
```

### 2. No Duplicates Check
```python
# spec_cleanup.py verifies:
backlog_specs & scope_specs == ∅      # No overlap
scope_specs & completed_specs == ∅    # No overlap
backlog_specs & completed_specs == ∅  # No overlap
```

### 3. Metadata Tracking
```json
// _meta.json in each phase
{
  "name": "user-auth",
  "status": "IN_SCOPE|COMPLETED",
  "scope_date": "2025-01-08T10:52:19",
  "completion_date": "2025-01-08T10:53:45",
  "workflow_id": "user-auth_20250108_105219",
  "implementation_location": "implementations/user-auth"
}
```

## 🔄 Error Recovery

### Interrupted Workflow
If workflow fails mid-execution:
1. Spec remains in `scope/` folder
2. Can resume with: `python start_workflow.py user-auth --source scope`
3. Or cleanup with: `python start_workflow.py --cleanup`

### Duplicate Detection
```bash
# Check for duplicates
python .claude/scripts/spec_cleanup.py

# Auto-fix duplicates
python .claude/scripts/spec_cleanup.py --auto-fix
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Typical Execution Times
- Phase 0 (Move to Scope): ~0.1s
- Phase 1 (Structure): ~0.5s
- Phase 2 (Requirements): ~0.2s (stubbed)
- Phase 3 (Design): ~0.2s (stubbed)
- Phase 4 (Tasks): ~0.2s (stubbed)
- Phase 5 (Code): ~1.0s (template generation)
- Phase 6 (Tests): ~0.3s
- Phase 7 (Docs): ~0.2s
- Phase 8 (Infrastructure): ~0.3s
- Phase 9 (Move to Completed): ~0.1s
- Phase 10 (Validation): ~0.5s

**Total**: ~3-5 seconds (without real agent calls)

With real agent calls, expect:
- Each agent call: 5-30 seconds
- Total workflow: 2-5 minutes

## 🔮 Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Implement Agent Bridge**
   ```python
   from agent_tool_bridge import AgentToolBridge
   self.bridge = AgentToolBridge()
   ```

2. **Add Real Agent Calls**
   ```python
   result = await self.bridge.delegate_to_agent(
       agent="developer",
       task="Implement authentication service",
       context=context
   )
   ```

3. **Integrate Context System**
   ```python
   from context_engine import ContextEngine
   self.context = ContextEngine()
   compressed = self.context.compress_context(data)
   ```

4. **Enable Memory Tracking**
   ```python
   from memory_manager import MemoryManager
   self.memory = MemoryManager()
   await self.memory.store_workflow_execution(...)
   ```
