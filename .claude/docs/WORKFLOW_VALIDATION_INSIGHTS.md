# Workflow Validation & Insights System

## Overview

The Workflow Validation system provides automated validation and developer insights as the **final step** of every workflow execution. It analyzes the entire workflow, validates outputs, and provides actionable recommendations.

## üìä Health Score System

The validator calculates a **Health Score** from 0-100 based on:

### Scoring Algorithm
```
Base Score: 100 points

Deductions:
- CRITICAL issue: -25 points
- HIGH issue: -15 points
- MEDIUM issue: -10 points
- WARNING: -5 points each

Bonuses:
- Complete documentation: +5 points
- All tests pass: +5 points
- Performance excellent: +5 points
```

### Health Score Grades

| Score | Grade | Status | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100 | EXCELLENT | ‚úÖ SUCCESS | Deploy ready |
| 70-89 | GOOD | ‚úÖ SUCCESS_WITH_WARNINGS | Review warnings |
| 50-69 | FAIR | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL_SUCCESS | Fix issues |
| 0-49 | POOR | ‚ùå FAILED | Manual intervention |

## üí° Insights Generated

The validator provides intelligent insights:

### 1. **Workflow Mode Detection**
```
INSIGHT: Workflow appears to be running in template mode
RECOMMENDATION: Use --mode logged or --mode full for AI generation
```

### 2. **Performance Analysis**
```
INSIGHT: Excellent performance - completed in 12.3s
DETAILS: All phases executed within optimal time
```

### 3. **Code Generation Success**
```
INSIGHT: Successfully generated 42 files
DETAILS: Complete implementation with tests
```

### 4. **Structure Compliance**
```
INSIGHT: Project structure follows steering document standards
DETAILS: All folders created per specifications
```

---

## üéØ Developer Action Items

The validator generates prioritized recommendations:

### Priority Levels

#### [HIGH] - Must Fix
```
ACTION: Fix compilation errors in services/user-auth-api/src/main.ts
COMMAND: npm run build --prefix services/user-auth-api
```

#### [MEDIUM] - Should Fix
```
ACTION: Move spec to completed folder
COMMAND: mv .claude/specs/scope/user-auth .claude/specs/completed/
```

#### [LOW] - Nice to Have
```
ACTION: Add infrastructure configurations
COMMAND: Create Kubernetes manifests in infrastructure/k8s/
```

## üìù Validation Report

Each validation generates a detailed report:

```markdown
# Workflow Validation Report

## Summary
- Spec: user-authentication
- Health Score: 85/100 [GOOD]
- Status: SUCCESS_WITH_WARNINGS

## Validation Results
### Passed Checks
- spec_lifecycle.completed ‚úÖ
- code_generation.files_created ‚úÖ
- project_structure.compliant ‚úÖ

### Issues Found
- [HIGH] Missing test files
- [MEDIUM] No infrastructure configs

## Insights
- Workflow completed successfully
- Consider adding integration tests
- Performance within acceptable range

## Recommendations
1. [HIGH] Generate missing test files
2. [MEDIUM] Add Docker configuration
3. [LOW] Update documentation
```

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### 1. Automatic Validation
Runs automatically as Phase 10 of every workflow:
```python
# In logged_workflow_executor.py
self.logger.start_phase("Automated Validation", "Validating workflow execution")
validation_success = await self.validate_execution()
```

### 2. Manual Validation
Run validation for any spec:
```bash
# Validate last workflow for a spec
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py user-auth --validate

# Or directly with validator
python .claude/scripts/workflow_validator.py user-auth
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Run Workflow
  run: python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py $SPEC --mode logged
  
- name: Validate Results
  run: python .claude/scripts/workflow_validator.py $SPEC
  continue-on-error: false  # Fail if health score < 70
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Standard Workflow with Validation
```bash
# Run workflow (validation included)
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py user-auth --mode logged

# Output includes:
[PHASE 10] Automated Validation
Running automated validation...
  [INSIGHT] Successfully generated 15 files
  [INSIGHT] Project structure follows standards
  
  Developer Action Items:
    [MEDIUM] Add integration tests
      -> npm test --prefix services/user-auth-api
    [LOW] Generate API documentation
      -> npm run docs

Health Score: [GOOD] [########--] 85%
Validation report: .claude/logs/workflows/20250808_105219_user-auth_validation.md
```

### Post-Execution Validation
```bash
# After workflow completes
python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py analytics-dashboard --validate

# Output:
[VALIDATING] Last workflow for spec: analytics-dashboard

## üîç Troubleshooting

### No Workflow Logs Found
```
Issue: No log file found for workflow
Solution: Ensure workflow ran with --mode logged or --mode full
```

### Low Health Score
```
Issue: Health score below 70
Solution: Review validation report for specific issues
Command: cat .claude/logs/workflows/*validation.md
```

### Validation Fails
```
Issue: Validation script errors
Solution: Check spec name and workflow completion
Command: python .claude/scripts/start_workflow.py --status
```
