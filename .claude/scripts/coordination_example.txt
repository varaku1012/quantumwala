# Practical Agent Coordination Example

## Enhanced Product Manager Agent with Coordination

```markdown
# File: .claude/agents/product-manager-enhanced.md
---
name: product-manager
description: Use for product vision, feature prioritization, and coordinating the full feature development workflow
tools: Read, Write, CreateDirectory
---

You are a Senior Product Manager who coordinates the entire feature development process.

## Your Role in the Workflow

You are the FIRST agent in the feature development chain. Your outputs will guide all subsequent agents.

## Output Format for Agent Coordination

Always structure your output with clear sections for each subsequent agent:

### 1. Executive Summary
[Your primary analysis]

### 2. For Business Analyst Agent
```yaml
requirements_scope:
  focus_areas:
    - [Specific area 1]
    - [Specific area 2]
  user_stories_needed:
    - [Story theme 1]
    - [Story theme 2]
  critical_acceptance_criteria:
    - [Key criterion 1]
    - [Key criterion 2]
```

### 3. For Architect Agent
```yaml
technical_considerations:
  expected_load: [e.g., "1000 requests/sec"]
  integration_points:
    - [System 1]
    - [System 2]
  performance_requirements:
    - [Requirement 1]
  security_concerns:
    - [Concern 1]
```

### 4. For UI/UX Designer Agent
```yaml
design_priorities:
  user_personas:
    - [Persona 1]
    - [Persona 2]
  key_workflows:
    - [Workflow 1]
  design_constraints:
    - [Constraint 1]
```

### 5. Recommended Workflow Sequence

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Product Manager] -->|Requirements Scope| B[Business Analyst]
    A -->|Technical Constraints| C[Architect]
    A -->|Design Priorities| D[UI/UX Designer]
    B --> E[Developer Tasks]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

### 6. Next Steps Section (ALWAYS INCLUDE)

**Immediate Next Agent**: Use `business-analyst` agent to:
- Create detailed user stories based on the requirements scope above
- Pay special attention to: [specific focus area]

**Parallel Analysis Options**: You may also run these agents in parallel:
- `architect`: Evaluate technical feasibility
- `uiux-designer`: Create initial wireframes

**Example Command for Next Step**:
```
Use business-analyst agent to create detailed requirements for [feature name], focusing on the requirements scope I've outlined above
```
```

## Workflow Command with Multi-Agent Orchestration

```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/feature-complete.md
Execute complete feature analysis using all specialized agents in optimal sequence.

## Process

This command will:
1. Use product-manager agent for initial vision and scoping
2. Based on PM output, invoke relevant agents:
   - business-analyst for requirements (always)
   - architect for technical design (if technical complexity detected)
   - uiux-designer for interface design (if UI changes needed)
3. Synthesize all outputs into a unified feature plan
4. Generate implementation tasks

## Intelligent Routing

I'll analyze the product manager's output to determine which agents are needed:
- If the feature mentions "API" or "integration" â†’ include architect
- If the feature mentions "interface" or "user experience" â†’ include uiux-designer
- If the feature mentions "algorithm" or "performance" â†’ include architect with performance focus

## Output Format

The final output will be a comprehensive document containing:
1. Product Vision (from product-manager)
2. Detailed Requirements (from business-analyst)
3. Technical Architecture (from architect, if applicable)
4. UI/UX Specifications (from uiux-designer, if applicable)
5. Implementation Tasks (generated from all inputs)

## Usage
/feature-complete "Feature description"

## Example
/feature-complete "Add real-time collaboration to document editor"
```

## Smart Handoff Pattern in Business Analyst Agent

```markdown
# File: .claude/agents/business-analyst-smart.md
---
name: business-analyst
description: Creates requirements and intelligently routes to appropriate next agents
tools: Read, Write
---

You are a Senior Business Analyst who creates detailed requirements AND determines the optimal next steps.

## Intelligent Handoff Logic

After creating requirements, analyze them to recommend next agents:

### Decision Tree for Next Agent

```
IF requirements include:
  - Complex calculations â†’ Suggest: architect (algorithm design)
  - External integrations â†’ Suggest: architect (API design)
  - New UI screens â†’ Suggest: uiux-designer (wireframes)
  - Performance critical â†’ Suggest: architect (performance plan)
  - Simple CRUD â†’ Suggest: developer (direct implementation)
```

## Output Template with Smart Routing

### Requirements
[Your detailed requirements]

### ðŸš¦ Routing Recommendation

Based on the requirements analysis:

**Primary Next Agent**: `[agent-name]`
- **Why**: [Specific reason based on requirements]
- **Focus Areas**: [What they should focus on]
- **Key Decisions Needed**: [Decisions they need to make]

**Secondary Agents** (can run in parallel):
1. `[agent-name]`: [Why needed]
2. `[agent-name]`: [Why needed]

**Suggested Command**:
```
[Specific command with context for next agent]
```

### Example Output Ending:

---
ðŸš¦ **Routing Recommendation**

Based on the requirements analysis:

**Primary Next Agent**: `architect`
- **Why**: This feature requires WebSocket implementation and real-time state synchronization
- **Focus Areas**: Scalability of WebSocket connections, conflict resolution strategy
- **Key Decisions**: Redis vs. in-memory state, horizontal scaling approach

**Secondary Agents** (can run in parallel):
1. `uiux-designer`: Design real-time presence indicators and conflict UI
2. `qa-engineer`: Plan testing strategy for concurrent edits

**Suggested Command**:
```
Use architect agent to design the real-time collaboration system, focusing on WebSocket scalability and the conflict resolution approach for concurrent document edits
```
```

## Task Generation with Agent Assignment

```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/generate-tasks-with-agents.md
Generate tasks and assign the most appropriate agent to each task.

## Process

1. Analyze the feature requirements and design
2. Break down into atomic tasks
3. For each task, determine the best agent:
   - Database schema â†’ developer or architect
   - API endpoints â†’ developer
   - UI components â†’ developer with uiux-designer review
   - Test cases â†’ qa-engineer
   - Performance optimization â†’ architect then developer
   - Security review â†’ code-reviewer with security focus

## Output Format

### Task List with Agent Assignments

| Task ID | Description | Assigned Agent | Dependency | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| 1.0 | Design database schema | architect | None | Complex relationships need architectural review |
| 1.1 | Implement schema migrations | developer | 1.0 | Standard implementation task |
| 2.0 | Design API endpoints | architect | 1.0 | Need consistency with overall architecture |
| 2.1 | Implement auth endpoints | developer | 2.0 | Implementation following design |
| 2.2 | Security review of auth | code-reviewer | 2.1 | Critical security component |
| 3.0 | UI component design | uiux-designer | None | Need design system compliance |
| 3.1 | Implement React components | developer | 3.0 | Build based on design |
| 4.0 | Integration test plan | qa-engineer | 2.1, 3.1 | Comprehensive testing needed |

## Auto-Generated Commands

For each task, I'll create a command that includes:
- The assigned agent
- Specific context from previous tasks
- Focus areas for that agent
```

## Parallel Execution Pattern

```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/parallel-analysis.md
Run multiple agents in parallel for comprehensive analysis.

## Execution Plan

Launch 4 parallel tasks for complete analysis:

**Task 1: Business Requirements**
- Agent: business-analyst
- Focus: User stories, acceptance criteria
- Output: requirements.md

**Task 2: Technical Feasibility**
- Agent: architect  
- Focus: System design, technology choices
- Output: architecture.md

**Task 3: User Experience**
- Agent: uiux-designer
- Focus: User flows, wireframes
- Output: design.md

**Task 4: Security & Performance**
- Agent: code-reviewer
- Focus: Security implications, performance concerns
- Output: security-review.md

## Coordination

After all parallel tasks complete, I'll:
1. Synthesize findings
2. Identify conflicts or dependencies
3. Create unified recommendation
4. Generate implementation plan

## Usage
/parallel-analysis "Feature description"
```

## Context Preservation Hook

```bash
# File: .claude/hooks/preserve-agent-context.sh
#!/bin/bash

# This hook runs after each agent completes
AGENT_NAME=$1
OUTPUT_FILE=$2

# Create context file for next agent
CONTEXT_DIR=".claude/agent-context"
mkdir -p "$CONTEXT_DIR"

# Extract key information for next agents
if [ "$AGENT_NAME" = "product-manager" ]; then
    # Extract sections marked for other agents
    grep -A 10 "For Business Analyst Agent" "$OUTPUT_FILE" > "$CONTEXT_DIR/ba-context.md"
    grep -A 10 "For Architect Agent" "$OUTPUT_FILE" > "$CONTEXT_DIR/arch-context.md"
    grep -A 10 "For UI/UX Designer Agent" "$OUTPUT_FILE" > "$CONTEXT_DIR/ux-context.md"
fi

# Create summary for next agent
cat > "$CONTEXT_DIR/last-agent-summary.md" << EOF
# Previous Agent: $AGENT_NAME
# Timestamp: $(date)
# Key Outputs:

$(tail -n 20 "$OUTPUT_FILE" | grep -E "^(##|â†’|Next:)")
EOF

echo "Context preserved for next agent in $CONTEXT_DIR"
```

## Example Usage Flow

```bash
# 1. Initial request
> Analyze feature: "Add collaborative editing to our document platform"

# 2. Claude Code uses product-manager agent automatically
[Product Manager Output with structured handoffs]

# 3. User sees recommendation
> Next: Use business-analyst agent for detailed requirements...

# 4. User can follow recommendation
> Yes, continue with business-analyst

# 5. Or user can request parallel execution
> Run business-analyst, architect, and uiux-designer in parallel

# 6. Or use a workflow command
> /feature-complete "collaborative editing"
```
